# Programming-groupwork
hello my name is Xinjie(Amer) WU(Barkawi)
this is my work record history,just proof that i write this code by myself.
Yesterday I wrote part of the code for the Notty game on November 19, 2024, from 3 pm to 10 pm in the library and in my apartment, and this part of the code was written for myself, and of course one of my classmates in the group gave some advice. I keep a record of the group chat to prove that the group member was involved in the development of the group game. The code I uploaded in this repository can only be used in the work team, if the code is leaked or other groups use the same code as me, the team members (excluding me) should be responsible for the code leak and academic misconduct. At the same time, I will appeal to the course leaders, Dr Colin Johnson and Dr Daniel Karapetyan, and make accusations of academic misconduct against the other team members. If required, I will report academic misconduct to the School Committee. I hereby declare that my code paper is allowed to be used by members of the programming team, and no one, including me, is allowed to leak this code, otherwise you will be held responsible!
